tasks:
========
      
  - create an issue: simplevocabs do not get alphabetically ordered,
    nore do they use the order defined by getObjectPositionInParent
    (see issue #4)

  - drop the try
    from Products.Archetypes.interfaces.vocabulary import IVocabularyTerm

  - we should add the parameter 'lang' to IVocabularyTerm.getTermValue
    [jens] agrees, but we should make it optional (normally translations should happen transparently)

  - move getTermPath to separate hierarchicalvocabulary interface?
    [hf] this would allow us to differentiate hierarchical vocabularies by their interface
         we'd should to make namedvocbaulary.getKeyPathForTerms aware of this too then...

  - (missing in alias) mark methods getVocabularyValue and getVocabularyKey as deprecated
    and use the methods getTermValue and getTermKey instead
    [jens] XXX

  - use zope3 interfaces for terms
    useful for example in NamedVocabulary.getKeyPathForTerms (see comment there)

  - resolve TODOs (XXX, FIXME) marked in the code ;-)


ideas for features:
=====================


selection-depth
-------------------

basic idea:
    fields can specify selection depth (0 unlimited, 1 first level, 2 seconde level, etc)
    that gets displayed in the Displaylist.

why do we need that:
    if a certain field does not need the fine-grained selection possibilities
    a vocabulary offers, no new vocabulary has to be defined.


variable displaylists
----------------------

basic idea:
	field can specify which attribute of the vocabularyterms is used for the
	displaylist.

why could we need that:
	in certain cases the same vocabulary is needed, but another field or field
	combination should be used for display in the selection.

risks/drawbacks:
	more complicated handling of cached displaylists (different dictionaries have
	to be handeled, not just one)


caching displaylists
----------------------

basic idea:
    caching of displaylists and vocabularydicts using ZCacheable (the only thing we'd
    have to care about is invalidating the cache when a term gets moved or changed)

why do we need that:
    fetching vocabulary displaylists costs a lot.
    at the moment the displaylist for the whole vocab gets fetched
    everytime a content type that uses the vocabulary is edited and even VIEWED!


[jens] will implement this for the vdex vocabulary in the near future: DONE
       open tasks: Invalidate cache after upload of a vdex.
                   (Auto?)-Assign to a ram-cache-manager.



generic setup support
----------------------

basic idea:
    vdex already can be ex and imported to xml. we shoud realize it for simple 
    and term too 
    [jens] decision needed: use vdex, some own xml or better atxml from marshall 
           or just simple Excel importable CSV?)
           
    Jens decision is: vdex (implemented import) or csv (todo). 


mixins:
-------
    common hierarchic functionality of vdex and tree and possibly other types
    should be coded in a mixin.
    code and test once, use everywhere


catalog updates
----------------

current limitation:

    every change on the structure of a vocabulary
    (eg: moving a term up the hierarchy)
    has to trigger not only the invalidation of the cache but also
    the reindexing of all terms down the hierarchy
    (uid_catalog search on getTermUidPath,
    catalog.manage_reindexIndex(ids=('getTermUidPath',)))

    currently this is a limitation of treevocabulary.
    vdex dont need to get cataloged


need to reindex objects in uid_catalog and portal_catalog:
    Which method do we need to hook?


in portal_catalog for indexes used by content types
    the worse problem is to reindex the objects that define custom
    indexes on their path-methods.
    we don't know which catalog they use (could be portal_catalog, but
    also any other)

    brainstorming:

      - store catalog and index in vocab or the atvmtool
      - provide a hook somewhere that can be implemented
      - maybe use references instead of text-linefields
        to be able to find out which content uses a certain term.
