  term path. [jensens] [hpeteragitator]

  of the vocabulary tree can be selected. [jensens] [hpeteragitator]

- Refactored getDisplayList for vdex vocabularies [jensens] [hpeteragitator]

- Run i18ndude and updated german translations [hpeteragitator]

- Let createSimpleVocabs accept dictionary keys as tuples of (id, title) (like
  createHierarchicalVocabs already does), to enable one to give the vocabulary
  a title.
  [jcbrand]

------------------

- Avoid deprecation warnings [WouterVH]

- Add MANIFEST.in to include top-level \*.txt-files. [WouterVH]


1.6 - 2011-02-22
----------------

- Don't fetch version and shortdesc from metadata.xml - this is wrong. [jensens]


1.6.0a2 - 2011-02-18
--------------------

- Changed method of dermining if LinguaPlone is installed. Asking QI does not
  work in Plone4. [naro]

- Added some missing dependencies, and a new extra section to setup.py.
  This helps to get a simple buildout cfg for testing against plone4. [do3cc]

- Added some sleeps between installs in the tests, else genericsetup
  creates ids twice, and fails. [do3cc]

- Temporary deactivated two checks in the tests. With
  Products.CMFQuickInstaller>=3.0.3, the portal_vocabularies don't get
  deleted during uninstall. [do3cc]

- Restructured test setup, since call semantics changed. [do3cc]


1.6.0a1 - 2010-07-16
--------------------

- Fixed deprecated API call to registerType without Package Name. Works now for
  Plone4. [thet]

- Added Products.LinguaPlone as test dependency to extras_require and begun
  fixing tests. [thet]

- Removed old slow VDEX implementation; added stub for import/export of vocabs
  with generixsetup; added support for vdex import with genericsetup. [jensens]


1.4.2 - 2008-06-04
------------------

- Added spanish translations provided by Diego Municio
  Cfr. http://plone.org/products/atvocabularymanager/issues/39.

- Merged in Duke's patch for multilingual csv import for simple vocabularies.
  Cfr. http://plone.org/products/atvocabularymanager/issues/53. [fRiSi]

- Fixed test setup so ATVM is set up using the new GS profile added by naro.
  (tested with plone 3.1.1 buildout)
  this fixes http://plone.org/products/atvocabularymanager/issues/52

- Got rid of tests.framework. [fRiSi]

- Added imsvdex as a required dependency in setup.py which makes it unnecessary
  to ``easy_install imsvdex`` for people using buildout. [fRiSi]

- Added GenericSetup profile, removed Install.py. [naro]


before 1.4
----------

- Workaround for  #46 Upload from Windows/IE creates wrong ID. [jensens]

- Made new VdexFileVocabulary as default for upload form. [jensens]

- Add alternative vdex vocabulary, much faster. [jensens]

- Added convinience method to vocabulary library (tool) which returns
  a dictionary with key=vocbaulary id and value=title of vocabulary (language
  aware. [jensens]

- Added convinience function to make it easier to fetch a value from a
  vocabulary dictionary (utils.vocabs.fetchValueByKeyFromVocabularyDict). [jensens]

- Adding css handles to various elements of portal_vocabulary user
  interface, so that if desired, one can easily dumb down the user
  interface for less technical clients with css, but not override the template
  [andrewburkhalter]

- Language negotation to make sure the cache is language aware. [jensens]

- In types/simple/vocabulary.py, applied patch of issue #4
  (sorting of simple vocabularies) [fRiSi]

- In doc/simplevocabulary.txt, add doctest testing the sorting of simplevocabularies
  sorting might not yet work with translated vocabularies. I added a section to
  test this, but did not yet write the tests there. [fRiSi]

- event.py, configure.zcml, interfaces.py, types/simple/term.py. [rocky]

- "renamed events" are now fired when the title of any term is updated. [rocky]

- "deleted events" are now fired when a term is deleted from a
  vocabulary; this particular feature will only work when running on
  Zope 2.9 or higher (note: this doesn't make ATVM dependent on Zope 2.9)
  [rocky]

- types/tree/vocabulary.py, types/simple/vocabulary.py
  replaced ``if not instance is None:`` with a try-except.
  if you are on a type that is not linguaplone enabled,
  and using a vocabulary you got an error when creating an
  object of this type because getLanguage raised an AttributeError. [fRiSi]

- types/tree/term.py
  to fix http://plone.org/products/atvocabularymanager/issues/26
  in the meantime i solved the problem with the "hack solution"
  to take away the IVocabulary interface from the term that is
  extending the vocabulary. [fRiSi]
  (see the issue above for more information.)

- Makefile
  added a new target `clean` that removes stale pyc files and ``-~`` backup
  files [fRiSi]

- namedvocabulary.py used to not add the keypath of a term if the search for a
  term uid in uid-catalog returned more than one value. proceeding and just taking
  the first result is better than silently ignoring the path for this item. [fRiSi]

- In Extensions/Install.py, did a cleaner check for BadRequest Error in case the tool already
  existed at install time (also added basic tests for installing/uninstalling/and
  reinstalling the product. [fRiSi]

- In Extensions/Install.py, self.portal.portal_properties.navtree_properties.metaTypesNotToList
  is a tuple by default (on a freshly created plonesite)
  ATVM creates a list at installation time and removes the tool from this list at
  uninstallation. If other products get installed between installing
  and uninstalling, they possibly change metaTypesNotToList back to a tuple again.
  changed the installer and uninstaller to operate on and return a tuple here.
  (should fix http://plone.org/products/atvocabularymanager/issues/10) [fRiSi]

- tests/testATVocabularyManager.py
  tests for the installation and uninstallation of the product.
  agreed with jens that we could do a zexp of the vocabularies at uninstallation
  in case this was done by accident.
  (http://plone.org/products/atvocabularymanager/issues/22/) [fRiSi]

- types/simple/term.py: removed bug, which stops me from adding new terms. [jensens]

- In types/simple/term.py, SimpleVocabularyTerms now return the canoncial's id
  as key. This differs from the current behaviour but is essential for translated
  vocabularies. [fRiSi]

- In types/simple/term.py,getTermKeyPath now returns a list containing the key of
  the term, not it's uid. This is consistent with the interface. [fRiSi]

- types/simple/vocabulary.py, types/tree/vocabulary.py
  GetVocabularyDict now uses instance.getLanguage in favour of
  portal_lanuages.getPreferredLanguage (otherwhise passing instance would be
  useless in most cases)

- tests/testSimpleVocabulary.py: Added a test that checks if translations return
  the same key and if dictionaries are translated.

- backports.py

  - Improved the docstrings to be more explicit.

  - getTermKey now states that all translations of a term
    have the same key.

  - getTermValue: now has an optional ``lang`` parameter
    making ``--kwargs`` needless.


- Add sorted simple vocabulary [gotcha]

- Run i18ndude and update fr and nl [gotcha]


- Merged branch supporting catalog searches on hierarchical vocabularies to trunk
  (https://svn.plone.org/svn/archetypes/ATVocabularyManager/branches/treevocab-frisi)
  [fRiSi]

- Merged current trunk into this branch. [fRiSi]

- Utils/vocabs.py
  utility methods for batch creating vocabularies.[fRiSi]

- types/simple/term.py types/tree/term.py
  Marked methods getVocabularyValue and getVocabularyKey as deprecated and used those
  defined in IVocabularyTerm to make terms implement their interface. [fRiSi]

- types/tree/vocabulary.py types/simple/vocabulary.py
  Improved linguaplone support and also added a testcase. [fRiSi]

- tests/testTreeVocabulary.py
  Testing if treevocabulary is linguaplone aware. [fRiSi]

- doc/search_treevocabulary.txt: A doctest explaining how ATVM performs searches
  on hierarchical vocabularies, and how to enable them for your content type.
  [fRiSi]

- Added dutch translations, thanks to Atopia. [jladage]

- AllowedTypesByIface is broken, it seems - adding manual override to fix this
  in ATVM. [optilude]

- Removed workflows from ATVM types on installation. [ferri]

- Added brazilian portuguese translation and portal_vocabularies title i18n
  support. [ferri]

- Added i18n and Czech translation. [naro]

- Uncommented code in Install.py to make portal_vocabularylib not show in the
  navigation tree. [panjunyong]

- Use StringWidget instead of IDWidget for Simple vocaublary term. [panjunyong]
